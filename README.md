# Features

* Type English, Cantonese, uppercase, lowercase, accents, non-accents, intonations, whatever, your shit shows up in big letters.
* So basically it shows you your English <-> Cantonese equivalent that you might have forgotten because Cantonese is hard.
* If this doesn't make sense don't worry, it's all for myself.

# Setup

* There's an environment variable to setup: file where to record the new words equivalence
